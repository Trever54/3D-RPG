# 3D-RPG
3D RPG Game created from following youtube tutorials by 'ThinMatrix' and adjusting them to my own creation. Following these tutorials gave me familiarity working with linear algebra and 3-dimensional math techniques in a programming environment. I also learned to work with the 3D modeling software 'Blender' and exporting 3D objects from Blender to something I could work with in Java. This program uses the LWJGL3 libraries and goes heavily into OpenGL and GLSW. 

I discontinued working on this project because of time constraints and the lack of having people to work on it with. The uploaded content is only the source code for this proect and doesn't contain any resources such as models and textures used during the programs execution. These are available upon request.
