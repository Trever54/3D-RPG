# 3D-RPG
3D RPG Game created from following youtube tutorials by 'ThinMatrix' and adjusting them to my own creation. Following these tutorials gave me familiarity working with linear algebra and 3-dimensional math techniques in a programming environment. I also learned to work with the 3D modeling software 'Blender' and exporting 3D objects from Blender to something I could work with in Java. This program uses the LWJGL3 libraries and goes heavily into OpenGL and GLSW. I discontinued working on this project because of time constraints and the lack of having people to work on it with.
